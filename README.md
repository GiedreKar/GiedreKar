## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

### I am Giedre

I recently completed a 12-month Data Analytics program at Turing College and am excited to take on new challenges. During this time, I worked on various projects and learned the following tools and languages:

- **Google Sheets**
- **SQL** (BigQuery, MySQL)
- **Power BI** (familiar with Tableau too)
- **Python**

Looking forward to applying my skills and continuing to grow!
